# StatsBombProject - Beating MSN

Coming off a treble in their first season with the threatening MSN trio up top, the 2014/2015 Barcelona team had one of the best seasons in the 2010's. Sporting a +89 goal differential, no La Liga team has topped that mark since. A strong season from Real Madrid saw them secure the regular season title in the second to last match. Nine days later, they would secure the Copa del Rey. Seven days after securing the double, Barcelona would face a Juventus team that won the Serie A by 17 points and completed their own domestic double. Two-thirds of MSN would score and lead Barcelona to their second Champions League title in five years. This project will investigate the defensive task that each La Liga team's coach and staff had leading up to their match against Barcelona: How can you beat (or at least slow down) Luis Enrique's Spanish powerhouse?
